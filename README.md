                                     SHREK
                         Once upon a time there was a lovely 
                         princess. But she had an enchantment 
                         upon her of a fearful sort which could 
                         only be broken by love's first kiss. 
                         She was locked away in a castle guarded 
                         by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. 
                         Many brave knights had attempted to 
                         free her from this dreadful prison, 
                         but non prevailed. She waited in the 
                         dragon's keep in the highest room of 
                         the tallest tower for her true love 
                         and true love's first kiss. (laughs) 
                         Like that's ever gonna happen. What 
                         a load of - (toilet flush)
 
               Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his 
               day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go 
               after the ogre.
 
               NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOME

                                     MAN1
                         Think it's in there?

                                     MAN2
                         All right. Let's get it!

                                     MAN1
                         Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that 
                         thing can do to you?
 
                                     MAN3
                         Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's 
                         bread.
 
               Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.

                                     SHREK
                         Yes, well, actually, that would be a 
                         giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. 
                         They'll make a suit from your freshly 
                         peeled skin.
 
                                     MEN
                         No!

                                     SHREK
                         They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the 
                         jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's 
                         quite good on toast.
 
                                     MAN1
                         Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! 
                         (waves the torch at Shrek.)
 
               Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The 
               men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long 
               and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the 
               men are in the dark.
 
                                     SHREK
                         This is the part where you run away. 
                         (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) 
                         And stay out! (looks down and picks 
                         up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. 
                         Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and 
                         throws the paper over his shoulder.)
 
                         
               THE NEXT DAY

               There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard 
               sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures 
               to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line 
               are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto 
               who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three 
               little pigs.
 
                                     GUARD
                         All right. This one's full. Take it 
                         away! Move it along. Come on! Get up!
 
                         
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Next!

                                     GUARD
                         (taking the witch's broom) Give me that! 
                         Your flying days are over. (breaks the 
                         broom in half)
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. 
                         Next!
 
                                     GUARD
                         Get up! Come on!

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Twenty pieces.

                                     LITTLE BEAR
                         (crying) This cage is too small.

                                     DONKEY
                         Please, don't turn me in. I'll never 
                         be stubborn again. I can change. Please! 
                         Give me another chance!
 
                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Oh, shut up. (jerks his rope)

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh!

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Next! What have you got?

                                     GIPETTO
                         This little wooden puppet.

                                     PINOCCHIO
                         I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his 
                         nose grows)
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Five shillings for the possessed toy. 
                         Take it away.
 
                                     PINOCCHIO
                         Father, please! Don't let them do this! 
                         Help me!
 
               Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up 
               to the table.
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Next! What have you got?

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Well, I've got a talking donkey.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings, 
                         if you can prove it.
 
                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Oh, go ahead, little fella.

               Donkey just looks up at her.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Well?

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Oh, oh, he's just...he's just a little 
                         nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. 
                         Talk, you boneheaded dolt...
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!
 
                         
                                     OLD WOMAN
                         No, no, he talks! He does. (pretends 
                         to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to 
                         talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing 
                         you ever saw.
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Get her out of my sight.

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!

               The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One 
               of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's 
               hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled 
               with fairy dust and he's able to fly.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey! I can fly!

                                     PETER PAN
                         He can fly!

                                     3 LITTLE PIGS
                         He can fly!

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         He can talk!

                                     DONKEY
                         Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm 
                         a flying, talking donkey. You might 
                         have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly 
                         but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey 
                         fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins 
                         to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink 
                         to the ground.)
 
               He hits the ground with a thud.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Seize him! (Donkey takes of running.) 
                         After him!
 
                                     GUARDS
                         He's getting away! Get him! This way! 
                         Turn!
 
               Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally. 
               Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared 
               for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He 
               quickly hides behind Shrek.
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         You there. Ogre!

                                     SHREK
                         Aye?

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         By the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized 
                         to place you both under arrest and transport 
                         you to a designated resettlement facility.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, really? You and what army?

               He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well 
               and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail 
               and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and 
               begins walking back to his cottage.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Can I say something to you? Listen, 
                         you was really, really, really somethin' 
                         back here. Incredible!
 
                                     SHREK
                         Are you talkin' to...(he turns around 
                         and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back 
                         around and Donkey is right in front 
                         of him.) Whoa!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell 
                         you that you that you was great back 
                         here? Those guards! They thought they 
                         was all of that. Then you showed up, 
                         and bam! They was trippin' over themselves 
                         like babes in the woods. That really 
                         made me feel good to see that.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, that's great. Really.

                                     DONKEY
                         Man, it's good to be free.

                                     SHREK
                         Now, why don't you go celebrate your 
                         freedom with your own friends? Hmm?
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         But, uh, I don't have any friends. And 
                         I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, 
                         wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll 
                         stick with you. You're mean, green, 
                         fightin' machine. Together we'll scare 
                         the spit out of anybody that crosses 
                         us.
 
               Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very 
               loudly.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you 
                         don't mind me sayin', if that don't 
                         work, your breath certainly will get 
                         the job done, 'cause you definitely 
                         need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause 
                         you breath stinks! You almost burned 
                         the hair outta my nose, just like the 
                         time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey 
                         continues to talk, so Shrek removes 
                         his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten 
                         berries. I had strong gases leaking 
                         out of my butt that day.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Why are you following me?

                                     DONKEY
                         I'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause 
                         I'm all alone, There's no one here beside 
                         me, My problems have all gone, There's 
                         no one to deride me, But you gotta have 
                         faith...
 
                                     SHREK
                         Stop singing! It's no wonder you don't 
                         have any friends.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Wow. Only a true friend would be that 
                         cruelly honest.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Listen, little donkey. Take a look at 
                         me. What am I?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really 
                         tall?
 
                                     SHREK
                         No! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your 
                         torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that 
                         bother you?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Nope.

                                     SHREK
                         Really?

                                     DONKEY
                         Really, really.

                                     SHREK
                         Oh.

                                     DONKEY
                         Man, I like you. What's you name?

                                     SHREK
                         Uh, Shrek.

                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek? Well, you know what I like about 
                         you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me 
                         thing. I like that. I respect that, 
                         Shrek. You all right. (They come over 
                         a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) 
                         Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live 
                         in place like that?
 
                                     SHREK
                         That would be my home.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. 
                         You know you are quite a decorator. 
                         It's amazing what you've done with such 
                         a modest budget. I like that boulder. 
                         That is a nice boulder. I guess you 
                         don't entertain much, do you?
 
                                     SHREK
                         I like my privacy.

                                     DONKEY
                         You know, I do too. That's another thing 
                         we have in common. Like I hate it when 
                         you got somebody in your face. You've 
                         trying to give them a hint, and they 
                         won't leave. There's that awkward silence. 
                         (awkward silence) Can I stay with you?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Uh, what?

                                     DONKEY
                         Can I stay with you, please?

                                     SHREK
                         (sarcastically) Of course!

                                     DONKEY
                         Really?

                                     SHREK
                         No.

                                     DONKEY
                         Please! I don't wanna go back there! 
                         You don't know what it's like to be 
                         considered a freak. (pause while he 
                         looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. 
                         But that's why we gotta stick together. 
                         You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Okay! Okay! But one night only.

                                     DONKEY
                         Ah! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage)
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         What are you...? (Donkey hops up onto 
                         a chair.) No! No!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         This is gonna be fun! We can stay up 
                         late, swappin' manly stories, and in 
                         the mornin' I'm makin' waffles.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh!

                                     DONKEY
                         Where do, uh, I sleep?

                                     SHREK
                         (irritated) Outside!

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, 
                         I don't know you, and you don't know 
                         me, so I guess outside is best, you 
                         know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek 
                         slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do 
                         like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was 
                         born outside. I'll just be sitting by 
                         myself outside, I guess, you know. By 
                         myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's 
                         no one here beside me...
 
               SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

               Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights 
               a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a 
               noise. He stands up with a huff.
 
                                     SHREK
                         (to Donkey) I thought I told you to 
                         stay outside.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (from the window) I am outside.

               There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that 
               made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns 
               and spots 3 blind mice on his table.
 
                                     BLIND MOUSE1
                         Well, gents, it's a far cry from the 
                         farm, but what choice do we have?
 
                         
                                     BLIND MOUSE2
                         It's not home, but it'll do just fine.
 
                         
                                     GORDO
                         (bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Got ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes 
                         and lands on his shoulder.)
 
                                     GORDO
                         I found some cheese. (bites Shrek's 
                         ear)
 
                                     SHREK
                         Ow!

                                     GORDO
                         Blah! Awful stuff.

                                     BLIND MOUSE1
                         Is that you, Gordo?

                                     GORDO
                         How did you know?

                                     SHREK
                         Enough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are 
                         you doing in my house? (He gets bumped 
                         from behind and he drops the mice.) 
                         Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves 
                         with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, 
                         no, no. Dead broad off the table.
 
                         
                                     DWARF
                         Where are we supposed to put her? The 
                         bed's taken.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Huh?

               Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain. 
               The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at 
               him.
 
                                     BIG BAD WOLF
                         What?

               TIME LAPSE

               Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging 
               him to the front door.
 
                                     SHREK
                         I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm 
                         a terrifying ogre! What do I have to 
                         do get a little privacy? (He opens the 
                         front door to throw the Wolf out and 
                         he sees that all the collected Fairy 
                         Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, 
                         no. No! No!
 
               The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his 
               pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing 
               flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.
 
               
                                     SHREK
                         What are you doing in my swamp? (this 
                         echoes and everyone falls silent.)
 
                         
               Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a 
               tent.
 
                                     SHREK
                         All right, get out of here. All of you, 
                         move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! 
                         Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more 
                         dwarves run inside the house) No, no! 
                         No, no. Not there. Not there. (they 
                         shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to 
                         look at Donkey)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, don't look at me. I didn't invite 
                         them.
 
                                     PINOCCHIO
                         Oh, gosh, no one invited us.

                                     SHREK
                         What?

                                     PINOCCHIO
                         We were forced to come here.

                                     SHREK
                         (flabbergasted) By who?

                                     LITTLE PIG
                         Lord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed 
                         and he...signed an eviction notice.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         (heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where 
                         this Farquaad guy is?
 
               Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, I do. I know where he is.

                                     SHREK
                         Does anyone else know where to find 
                         him? Anyone at all?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Me! Me!

                                     SHREK
                         Anyone?

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! 
                         Me, me!
 
                                     SHREK
                         (sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy 
                         tale things. Do not get comfortable. 
                         Your welcome is officially worn out. 
                         In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad 
                         right now and get you all off my land 
                         and back where you came from! (Pause. 
                         Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) 
                         You! You're comin' with me.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         All right, that's what I like to hear, 
                         man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart 
                         friends, off on a whirlwind big-city 
                         adventure. I love it!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (singing) On the road again. Sing it 
                         with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get 
                         on the road again.
 
                                     SHREK
                         What did I say about singing?

                                     DONKEY
                         Can I whistle?

                                     SHREK
                         No.

                                     DONKEY
                         Can I hum it?

                                     SHREK
                         All right, hum it.

               Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'.

               DULOC - KITCHEN

               A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually 
               dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         That's enough. He's ready to talk.
 
                         
               The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down 
               onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the 
               table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes 
               up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.
 
               
                                     FARQUAAD
                         (he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs 
                         and plays with them) Run, run, run, 
                         as fast as you can. You can't catch 
                         me. I'm the gingerbread man.
 
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         You are a monster.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         I'm not the monster here. You are. You 
                         and the rest of that fairy tale trash, 
                         poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell 
                         me! Where are the others?
 
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         Eat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's 
                         eye.)
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         I've tried to be fair to you creatures. 
                         Now my patience has reached its end! 
                         Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to 
                         pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons)
 
                         
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         No, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop 
                         buttons.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         All right then. Who's hiding them?
 
                         
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         Okay, I'll tell you. Do you know the 
                         muffin man?
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         The muffin man?

                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         The muffin man.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives 
                         on Drury Lane?
 
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         Well, she's married to the muffin man.
 
                         
                                     FARQUAAD
                         The muffin man?

                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         The muffin man!

                                     FARQUAAD
                         She's married to the muffin man.

               The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         My lord! We found it.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Then what are you waiting for? Bring 
                         it in.
 
               More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet. 
               They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic 
               Mirror.
 
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         (in awe) Ohhhh...

                         Magic mirror...

                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         Don't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks 
                         him up and dumps him into a trash can 
                         with a lid.) No!
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Evening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. 
                         Is this not the most perfect kingdom 
                         of them all?
 
                                     MIRROR
                         Well, technically you're not a king.
 
                         
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Uh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a 
                         hand mirror and smashes it with his 
                         fist.) You were saying?
 
                                     MIRROR
                         What I mean is you're not a king yet. 
                         But you can become one. All you have 
                         to do is marry a princess.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Go on.

                         (chuckles nervously) So, just sit back 
                         and relax, my lord, because it's time 
                         for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. 
                         And here they are! Bachelorette number 
                         one is a mentally abused shut-in from 
                         a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi 
                         and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies 
                         include cooking and cleaning for her 
                         two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. 
                         (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette 
                         number two is a cape-wearing girl from 
                         the land of fancy. Although she lives 
                         with seven other men, she's not easy. 
                         Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and 
                         find out what a live wire she is. Come 
                         on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows 
                         picture of Snow White) And last, but 
                         certainly not last, bachelorette number 
                         three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded 
                         castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! 
                         But don't let that cool you off. She's 
                         a loaded pistol who likes pina colads 
                         and getting caught in the rain. Yours 
                         for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows 
                         picture of Princess Fiona) So will it 
                         be bachelorette number one, bachelorette 
                         number two or bachelorette number three?

                         Three! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number 
                         three, my lord!

                         Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess 
                         Fiona.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Princess Fiona. She's perfect. All I 
                         have to do is just find someone who 
                         can go...

                         But I probably should mention the little 
                         thing that happens at night.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         I'll do it.

                         Yes, but after sunset...

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Silence! I will make this Princess Fiona 
                         my queen, and DuLoc will finally have 
                         the perfect king! Captain, assemble 
                         your finest men. We're going to have 
                         a tournament. (smiles evilly)
 
               DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section

               Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking 
               lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         But that's it. That's it right there. 
                         That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         So, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Uh-huh. That's the place.

                                     SHREK
                         Do you think maybe he's compensating 
                         for something? (He laughs, but then 
                         groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. 
                         He continues walking through the parking 
                         lot.)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.

                                     MAN
                         Hurry, darling. We're late. Hurry.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Hey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing 
                         a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, 
                         screams and begins running through the 
                         rows of rope to get to the front gate 
                         to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. 
                         Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just 
                         - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins 
                         walking straight through the rows. The 
                         attendant runs into a wall and falls 
                         down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then 
                         continue on into DuLoc.)
 
               DULOC

               They look around but all is quiet.

                                     SHREK
                         It's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody?
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, look at this!

               Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box 
               marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors 
               open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin 
               to sing.
 
                                     WOODEN PEOPLE

               Don't make waves, stay in line

               And we'll get along fine

               DuLoc is perfect place

               DuLoc is, DuLoc is

               DuLoc is perfect place.

               Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.

                                     DONKEY
                         Wow! Let's do that again! (makes ready 
                         to run over and pull the lever again)
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         (grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) 
                         No. No. No, no, no! No.
 
               They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Brave knights. You are the best and 
                         brightest in all the land. Today one 
                         of you shall prove himself...
 
               As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena 
               Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song.
 
                                     SHREK
                         All right. You're going the right way 
                         for a smacked bottom.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Sorry about that.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         That champion shall have the honor - 
                         - no, no - - the privilege to go forth 
                         and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona 
                         from the fiery keep of the dragon. If 
                         for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, 
                         the first runner-up will take his place 
                         and so on and so forth. Some of you 
                         may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing 
                         to make. (cheers) Let the tournament 
                         begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is 
                         that? It's hideous!
 
                                     SHREK
                         (turns to look at Donkey and then back 
                         at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. 
                         It's just a donkey.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Indeed. Knights, new plan! The one who 
                         kills the ogre will be named champion! 
                         Have it him!
 
                                     MEN
                         Get him!

                                     SHREK
                         Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps 
                         into a table where there are mugs of 
                         beer)
 
                                     CROWD
                         Go ahead! Get him!

                                     SHREK
                         (holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just 
                         settle this over a pint?
 
                                     CROWD
                         Kill the beast!

                                     SHREK
                         No? All right then. (drinks the beer) 
                         Come on!
 
               He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel 
               of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the 
               other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides 
               past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped. 
               As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger 
               beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll. 
               Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much 
               fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice 
               to say that Shrek kicks butt.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!

               Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek 
               gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Yeah!

               A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time 
               and sees him.
 
                                     WOMAN
                         The chair! Give him the chair!

               Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men 
               are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding 
               sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you 
                         very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try 
                         the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)
 
               The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on 
               Shrek.
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Shall I give the order, sir?

                                     FARQUAAD
                         No, I have a better idea. People of 
                         DuLoc, I give you our champion!
 
                                     SHREK
                         What?

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Congratulations, ogre. You're won the 
                         honor of embarking on a great and noble 
                         quest.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Quest? I'm already in a quest, a quest 
                         to get my swamp back.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Your swamp?

                                     SHREK
                         Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those 
                         fairy tale creatures!
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Indeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you 
                         a deal. Go on this quest for me, and 
                         I'll give you your swamp back.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Exactly the way it was?

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Down to the last slime-covered toadstool.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         And the squatters?

                                     FARQUAAD
                         As good as gone.

                                     SHREK
                         What kind of quest?

               Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field 
               heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Let me get this straight. You're gonna 
                         go fight a dragon and rescue a princess 
                         just so Farquaad will give you back 
                         a swamp which you only don't have because 
                         he filled it full of freaks in the first 
                         place. Is that about right?
 
                                     SHREK
                         You know, maybe there's a good reason 
                         donkeys shouldn't talk.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         I don't get it. Why don't you just pull 
                         some of that ogre stuff on him? Throttle 
                         him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds 
                         his bones to make your bread, the whole 
                         ogre trip.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have 
                         decapitated an entire village and put 
                         their heads on a pike, gotten a knife, 
                         cut open their spleen and drink their 
                         fluids. Does that sound good to you?
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Uh, no, not really, no.

                                     SHREK
                         For your information, there's a lot 
                         more to ogres than people think.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Example?

                                     SHREK
                         Example? Okay, um, ogres are like onions. 
                         (he holds out his onion)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (sniffs the onion) They stink?

                                     SHREK
                         Yes - - No!

                                     DONKEY
                         They make you cry?

                                     SHREK
                         No!

                                     DONKEY
                         You leave them in the sun, they get 
                         all brown, start sproutin' little white 
                         hairs.
 
                                     SHREK
                         No! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres 
                         have layers! Onions have layers. You 
                         get it? We both have layers. (he heaves 
                         a sigh and then walks off)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (trailing after Shrek) Oh, you both 
                         have layers. Oh. {Sniffs} You know, 
                         not everybody likes onions. Cake! Everybody 
                         loves cakes! Cakes have layers.
 
                                     SHREK
                         I don't care... what everyone likes. 
                         Ogres are not like cakes.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         You know what else everybody likes? 
                         Parfaits. Have you ever met a person, 
                         you say, "Let's get some parfait," they 
                         say, "Hell no, I don't like no parfait"? 
                         Parfaits are delicious.
 
                                     SHREK
                         No! You dense, irritating, miniature 
                         beast of burden! Ogres are like onions! 
                         And of story. Bye-bye. See ya later.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Parfaits may be the most delicious thing 
                         on the whole damn planet.
 
                                     SHREK
                         You know, I think I preferred your humming.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Do you have a tissue or something? I'm 
                         making a mess. Just the word parfait 
                         make me start slobbering.
 
               They head off. There is a montage of their journey. Walking through 
               a field at sunset. Sleeping beneath a bright moon. Shrek trying 
               to put the campfire out the next day and having a bit of a problem, 
               so Donkey pees on the fire to put it out.
 
               DRAGON'S KEEP

               Shrek and Donkey are walking up to the keep that's supposed to 
               house Princess Fiona. It appears to look like a giant volcano.
 
               
                                     DONKEY
                         (sniffs) Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that? 
                         You gotta warn somebody before you just 
                         crack one off. My mouth was open and 
                         everything.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd 
                         be dead. (sniffs) It's brimstone. We 
                         must be getting close.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking 
                         about it's the brimstone. I know what 
                         I smell. It wasn't no brimstone. It 
                         didn't come off no stone neither.
 
                         
               They climb up the side of the volcano/keep and look down. There 
               is a small piece of rock right in the center and that is where 
               the castle is. It is surrounded by boiling lava. It looks very 
               foreboding.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Sure, it's big enough, but look at the 
                         location. (laughs...then the laugh turns 
                         into a groan)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said 
                         ogres have layers?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, aye.

                                     DONKEY
                         Well, I have a bit of a confession to 
                         make. Donkeys don't have layers. We 
                         wear our fear right out there on our 
                         sleeves.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         You know what I mean.

                                     SHREK
                         You can't tell me you're afraid of heights.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         No, I'm just a little uncomfortable 
                         about being on a rickety bridge over 
                         a boiling like of lava!
 
                                     SHREK
                         Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside 
                         ya, okay? For emotional support., we'll 
                         just tackle this thing together one 
                         little baby step at a time.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Really?

                                     SHREK
                         Really, really.

                                     DONKEY
                         Okay, that makes me feel so much better.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Just keep moving. And don't look down.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Okay, don't look down. Don't look down. 
                         Don't look down. Keep on moving. Don't 
                         look down. (he steps through a rotting 
                         board and ends up looking straight down 
                         into the lava) Shrek! I'm lookin' down! 
                         Oh, God, I can't do this! Just let me 
                         off, please!
 
                                     SHREK
                         But you're already halfway.

                                     DONKEY
                         But I know that half is safe!

                                     SHREK
                         Okay, fine. I don't have time for this. 
                         You go back.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek, no! Wait!

                                     SHREK
                         Just, Donkey - - Let's have a dance 
                         then, shall me? (bounces and sways the 
                         bridge)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Don't do that!

                                     SHREK
                         Oh, I'm sorry. Do what? Oh, this? (bounces 
                         the bridge again)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Yes, that!

                                     SHREK
                         Yes? Yes, do it. Okay. (continues to 
                         bounce and sway as he backs Donkey across 
                         the bridge)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         No, Shrek! No! Stop it!

                                     SHREK
                         You said do it! I'm doin' it.

                                     DONKEY
                         I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, 
                         I'm gonna die. (steps onto solid ground) 
                         Oh!
 
                                     SHREK
                         That'll do, Donkey. That'll do. (walks 
                         towards the castle)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Cool. So where is this fire-breathing 
                         pain-in-the-neck anyway?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Inside, waiting for us to rescue her. 
                         (chuckles)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek.
 
                         
               INSIDE THE CASTLE

                                     DONKEY
                         You afraid?

                                     SHREK
                         No.

                                     DONKEY
                         But...

                                     SHREK
                         Shh.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, good. Me neither. (sees a skeleton 
                         and gasps) 'Cause there's nothin' wrong 
                         with bein' afraid. Fear's a sensible 
                         response to an unfamiliar situation. 
                         Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I might 
                         add. With a dragon that breathes fire 
                         and eats knights and breathes fire, 
                         it sure doesn't mean you're a coward 
                         if you're a little scared. I sure as 
                         heck ain't no coward. I know that.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Donkey, two things, okay? Shut ... up. 
                         Now go over there and see if you can 
                         find any stairs.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Stairs? I thought we was lookin' for 
                         the princess.
 
                                     SHREK
                         (putting on a helmet) The princess will 
                         be up the stairs in the highest room 
                         in the tallest tower.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         What makes you think she'll be there?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         I read it in a book once. (walks off)
